## About me ðŸ¤”

Faculty member in Department of Mathematics, Saintgits College of Engineering (Autonomous), Kottayam. Handling classes in pure & Applied Mathematics , and presently serving as a Resource Person for the AI & ML course offered by IIT Madras and Gov.~ of Kerala. Serving as Data Analysis and Analytics consultant for Finance, Economics , Social Sciences and Engineering .

As a part of the professional life I have over 18 years of experience in Teaching that involved Undergraduate, Graduate, Post Graduate and Professional courses in Science , Engineering& Technology.

During my stint at computational mathematics, I  have trained myself with ToTs from prominent institutes like IIT(M), ASDC (Gov.~ of Kerala) in modern technologies like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Business Analytics. Currently handling skill training related to Research, AI and Analytics services of research scholars. 

 I have led many FDPs and STTPs in Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence.
